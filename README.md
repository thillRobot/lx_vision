# lx_vision
  This is a ROS package for camera and computer vison for the Pioneer LX Robot at Tennessee Technological University 

## Updating to Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic 

### Overview

The LX robot at Tennessee Tech ran in Ubuntu Mate 16.04 for a long time. In the summer of 2021, the embedded Intel Atom computer was updated to Ubuntu Mate 20.04. An Intel NUC (thanks RTT) is now used as the control computer and development environment. 

The robot is intended to be used for guest demos and testing for the tour guide/greeter robot. Currently the SICK LiDAR is the primary sensor used for obstacle detection and navigation. In addition to LiDAR, the LX robot needs vison to increase safety and effectiveness during human interaction. 

### Goals
- [] enable Kinect V1 currently mounted and wired to LX robot
- [] enable rtabmap algorithms from Kinetic (archived launch files)
- [] add addtional two more kinects to increase fieid of view
- [] enable ZED stereo camera
- [] enable human detection, skeleton detecton, gesture detection

### Approach

There are serveral ways to approach this. To begin, I want to test the rtabmap algoritms that were used with the LX in Kinetic. The launch files from Kinetic are archived in this repository so this should work!

**Single Computer Approach:** Cameras directly on LX embedded computer (Intel Atom dual core 64bit)
	I  predict there will be resource limitations due to the age of the computer.

**Distributed Approach:** Cameras on separate camera module computer on-board robot.

- Camera Module Option 1: Intel i3/i5 - Lenovo M73 TinyDesktop 
- Camera Module Option 2: Nvidia Jetson Nano 2Gb/4Gb or TX2 NX (4Gb)
- Camera Module Option 3: Raspberry Pi 3b 
	
### Camera Selection

Goal: DO STUFF with RTABMAP and LX

    THis should work with a single launch file! MAKE THAT HAPPEN!:

    ON THE ROBOT COMPUTER (the kinect is plugged into the external usb port on LX)

        thill@robot:~$ roslaunch ttu_camera lx_3dmap.launch

	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ roslaunch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch rgb_topic:=/camera/data_throttled_image depth_topic:=/camera/data_throttled_image_depth camera_info_topic:=/camera/data_throttled_camera_info compressed:=true rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start"


	Now you should see the mapping in the rtabmapviz window! Woop Woop!
	Close the terminals and then do this.

	    thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ rtabmap-databaseViewer ~/.ros/rtabmap.db

	You can now save the file as a .ply and open it with 'meshlab'

  This works but my launch files should work!
