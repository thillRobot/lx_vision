# lx_vision
  This is a ROS package for camera and computer vison for the Pioneer LX Robot. 
Goal: DO STUFF with RTABMAP and LX

    THis should work with a single launch file! MAKE THAT HAPPEN!:

    ON THE ROBOT COMPUTER (the kinect is plugged into the external usb port on LX)

        thill@robot:~$ roslaunch ttu_camera lx_3dmap.launch

	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ roslaunch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch rgb_topic:=/camera/data_throttled_image depth_topic:=/camera/data_throttled_image_depth camera_info_topic:=/camera/data_throttled_camera_info compressed:=true rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start"


	Now you should see the mapping in the rtabmapviz window! Woop Woop!
	Close the terminals and then do this.

	    thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ rtabmap-databaseViewer ~/.ros/rtabmap.db

	You can now save the file as a .ply and open it with 'meshlab'



  This works but my launch files should work!
